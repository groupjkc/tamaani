Dear Jeannie=2C
=20
I have tried to reach you but obviously you are not taking my calls. I am w=
riting to you as your Aunt and as an individual who is very concerned about=
 the situation at the health board. I often find myself a spokesperson for =
others who are not able to say the things they want to say. Having received=
 a call from one of the Board members of Nunavik Health Board=2C the call p=
ropelled me into writing this email although I have thought about doing it =
many times before.  I want to let you know that many people are concerned a=
bout your lack of involvement in the management of the health board. I beli=
eve I am doing you justice in letting you know this. I am sending a copy of=
 this email to the chair of the NRBHSS as she and the rest of the Board of =
Directors are ultimately responsible for the operation of the Board and are=
 responsible to provide supervision to the Executive Director.
=20
As witnessed by many=2C your lack of involvement and absences over the past=
 5 years and more (I am not speaking about legitimate absences such as mate=
rnity leave=2C justified sick leave=2C annual holidays=2C etc. as these are=
 benefits that all employees are entitled to) are astronomical and your com=
plete lack of interest in the work of the Executive Director of the Nunavik=
 Health Board is apparent to many people. Over the past 5 years=2C your abs=
ences have included numerous and prolonged trips to B.C. to visit one of yo=
ur children=92 father over a 2-3 year period. For the past two years and mo=
re=2C your trips to the Dominican Republic have been exhaustive=2C frequent=
 once again in connection to visiting your current husband. I am not passin=
g judgment on your personal life=2C that is your business. However=2C your =
absences and total lack of commitment and neglect provide no continuity to =
the Board have leave the organization in serious and precarious jeopardy.
=20
The role of Executive Director are key to the running of the organization. =
The Executive Director is responsible for the implementation of decisions m=
ade by the Executive Committee and the Board of Directors and has to ensure=
 that the administrative Directors continually work towards the direction t=
hat the BOD decides on. The departments=2C through their directors must be =
supervised and supported on a continual basis by their Executive Director. =
Without the support and guidance=2C an organization will go directionless a=
nd its work will be very ineffectual. This is the situation that I and many=
 others feel is the state the Health Board is in right now and has been for=
 a long time now. You are responsible for many critical files at the health=
 board but you do not take your job seriously by any stretch of the imagina=
tion.
=20
As Inuit we are in great crises at this time in our history. The Nunavik Re=
gional Board of Health and Social Services=2C has the mandate to provide st=
rong and effective services to the Inuit of Nunavik. The Board is provided =
a great deal of money by Governments to do this job. My interpretation of y=
our work is that you are not interested in doing it at all=2C nor do you ca=
re and I have found this disturbing over the years. As you know=2C I have a=
ttempted many times to support you and get you involved in the issues that =
are important to the wellbeing of our people as well as other issues we are=
 concerned about as Inuit. Each and every time I have tried to speak with y=
ou to involve you over the past years=2C your response to me has always bee=
n that you don=92t interfere with the work of department heads and that it =
is their responsibility and not yours to deal with things so I have to spea=
k with them instead. I have never had any problems with dept. heads who are=
 Inuit-I am not concerned about them as they are not in contradiction. It i=
s not the Inuit department heads who do not respect the wishes of the Board=
 of Directors. It is the non Inuit department heads who either do not agree=
 with the way the Board wants to do things are are still oppressing us and =
thinking they know better than we do as Inuit who I am concerned about. Par=
t of your role is to definitely intervene with them if they are not complyi=
ng. You as the Executive Director has to be in the front lines ready to wor=
k everyday and ensure that the Board=92s direction is adhered to.  That is =
what you are paid to do. There is much work to be done in Health and Social=
 Services-the staff at the Board need support and guidance.  Your complete =
lack of interest in critical areas has left the people of Nunavik in a very=
 vulnerable position.  The people deserve more.
=20
I believe I am doing you a great favor by letting you know this and even if=
 you do not realize it now=2C perhaps you will one day. I believe it is imp=
ortant for you to come to a decision about whether you are interest in this=
 work or not. There are people able and willing to do the job of Executive =
Director if you are not ready and willing to give it your best. Furthermore=
=2C the Health Board is not a private business owned by a few-it is a publi=
c institution and people who are privileged to work in it are accountable t=
o both the public it serves and the funders.
=20
I trust you will carefully consider what I have written.
