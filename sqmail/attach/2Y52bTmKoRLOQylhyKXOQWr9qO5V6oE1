Joan,


As per our telephone conversation today please forward M&R's contact =
information to NIC's IT service providers by either calling them or =
forwarding this email accordingly.


It is to be noted that the LMS system utilizes the 'MSOffice-32 Bit' =
environment exporting reports in MSWord, PDF and MSExcel document =
formats.  The core engine used by the LMS is 'MSAccess-32bit' which can =
be purchase and installed separately; it would be advisable to purchase =
a site license for MSAccess for up to five (5) computers in the event =
your office requires more personnel to use the LMS system concurrently. =
M&R will advise your IT department on the LMS system specifications when =
they contact us.


Should there be any questions or concerns on the above please contact me =
directly at your convenience.
=20
Regards,
Rod Archibald,=20
