Alicie,

Liza Cotnoir asked me to contact you as she is on vacation.

Liza informed me that the board wanted to hire a new Center Director and an=
 Assistant Director.  Before doing so, the board must check the budget to k=
now if there is enough money to pay another salary before opening any new j=
obs and from speaking with Liza,  I understand that Mikijuk Childcare Cente=
r does not have much money at this time.  When and if you hire a new childc=
are Center Director, be sure too, that the candidate is informed that accor=
ding to the management policy, the Center Director is paid on an annual sal=
ary and does not make overtime hours and that they must also sign an employ=
ee agreement with the childcare center.  The board has to decide the salary=
 before hiring the person.  If you do not have a copy of the management sal=
ary scale or employee contract, please let me know and I will send a copy.

The other thing I wanted to inform you about is that the President and the =
Vice-President of the childcare center must be parent users of the service =
and so unless you have a child attending the service, you cannot be the Pre=
sident.  As a community representative on the board, you can be a regular b=
oard member but you cannot be the President or Vice-President.  Your board =
will need to modify the composition of the Board at the next meeting and se=
nd us the new information.  I am updating the letters patent of each childc=
are center and so I need to have this information as soon as possible.

Thank you,

Lisa Epoo
