Good day Alasie,

Been doing good, hope all is well with you too!

For the compassionate fare, the 75% discount comes up to $875.02 each
taxes included round trip from Wakeham to Montreal and back.
I am just missing the return date for your children to be able to reserve
them. I see in the email below going on August 10th but I can not see when
they need to go back home.

If you could please email me the info, I will proceed immediately.

Hi Cynthia,





Been along time, Hope you been doing well.

Ok to make a reservation for my two kids from Kangirsujuaq W-Bay to Mtl on
the August 10 return on the Aug.

There name Jasua Arngak, And Levina Arngak.

Thank you have a good weekend.







Alasie Arngak.



















Good afternoon Alasie,
Sorry for the late reply.

Been trying to catch up work, Elder's excursion is taking a lot of my
time to this hour.

But Air Inuit will be happy to provide:

Levina Arngak from Kuujjuak to Montreal return
And for Jasua Arngak from Kangirsujuaq return

A compassionate fare rate (Ilaujuq fare).  When you are ready to make
the reservations, you may call our head office at 1.800.361.5933 and
ask for Ms. Cynthia Cartolano of Passenger Services, she is ready to
help you on this.

These compassionate fare are not free passes but discounts.

You may ask Mr. Markusi Qisiiq, your local Makivik Board member for
one of local pass but it is not our call, these passes are intend to
help the community for raising funds, fesitivities or in emergency
cases.


Wishing you a safe travel and a good day.


Noah Tayara
Air Inuit Board member
