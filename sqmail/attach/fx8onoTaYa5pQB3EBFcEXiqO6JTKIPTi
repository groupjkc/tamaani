Hi Alasie,

It's good to hear from you, Qanuingitunga and my family.

Yes, I am going down to Cape Dorset tomorrow. I will try to remember a CD 
for you.

I have been really busy. We as a local church has grown and we are still 
growing. So, it's keeping me busier than before.

Overflow blessings
Billy
