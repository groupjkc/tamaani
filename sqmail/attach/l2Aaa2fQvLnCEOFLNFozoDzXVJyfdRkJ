Hi Alasie,

I was in Cape Dorset with other leaders from Nunavut and Nunavik the 
meetings were awesome.

I am sorry I forgot to take the CD's with me to Cape Dorset.
I am leaving again for Pang in an hour until friday. Then early next week I 
will be in Rankin Inlet and Coral Harbour.
I will send you a CD when I have time.

Keep me in your prayers as I will be busy within the next few weeks.

Love in Christ (The Anointed One and His Anointing)

Billy
