Hello Alasie,

Based on the report dated April 27 submitted by Jean-Guy Letourneau, I 
would be ready to meet with the Mayor of Cote St Luc. As I mentioned in my 
e-mail of April 28th, I need to present this project to the Board of 
Compensation on either May 30 or 31st. Knowing the reaction of  Mayor 
Housefather and any other of business related to securing this property 
would be critical information in addressing this to the Board of 
Compensation.
I will be away for the week of May 9 - 13. I will be in Montreal for 
meetings on May 18, 19 and 20. I think the following week, early as 
possible would be a good time to have this meeting with the Mayor. Being 
accompanied by persons working in Patient Services from the Cree and Inuit 
organizations would be very helpful to explain the nature of the services 
we want to to establish there.
As I mentioned in my April 28th e-mail, it is critical that we have the 
financial information of both the Cree and Inuit Patients Services 
operations to know of the viability of securing a lease with CreeCo and it 
would need that guarantee to go to a financial institiution for financing 
as well as using its own resources towards the purchase of the property.

thank you
