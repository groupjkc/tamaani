<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>It is to be noted that the LMS system utilizes the 'MSOffice-32 
Bit'&nbsp;environment exporting reports in&nbsp;MSWord,&nbsp;PDF 
and&nbsp;MSExcel document formats.&nbsp;&nbsp;The core engine used by the LMS is 
'MSAccess-32bit' which can be purchase and installed separately; it would be 
advisable to purchase a site license for MSAccess for up to five (5) 
computers&nbsp;in the event your office&nbsp;requires more personnel to use the 
LMS system concurrently.&nbsp;<EM>M&amp;R</EM> will advise your IT department on 
the LMS system specifications when they contact us.</DIV>

Computer Solutions Ltd" &lt;mrsupport@shaw.ca&gt;<BR>Subject: Re: LMS conversion 
information required<BR><BR>&gt;&gt;Rod,<BR>&gt; The IT guys were here this 
morning &amp; said i don't have that MSAccess<BR>&gt; version installed &amp; 
was wondering why i needed it.I told them it was so<BR>&gt; when you return it 
is needed with the new LMS installation.They would<BR>&gt; like for you to 
contact them at www.soleica.ca.I my self can't download<BR>&gt; things on this 
computer,it is all done by Soleica's IT person's<BR>&gt; 
administratior.<BR>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; The reason i never out March transactions is 
because we start our<BR>&gt; fiscal year in the beginning of April,but i will do 
the things you need<BR>&gt; when i have free time &amp; resend it to 
you.<BR>&gt; Thanks Jon<BR>&gt; <BR>&gt; <BR>&gt; <BR>&gt; 
Joan,<BR>&gt;&gt;<BR>&gt;&gt;<BR>&gt;&gt;<BR>&gt;&gt; Please review the list of 
information noted below M&amp;R requires prior to<BR>&gt;&gt; scheduling a 
return date for the LMS installation and 
training:<BR>&gt;&gt;<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1.. Available dates in July/August 
that you are available for M&amp;R's<BR>&gt;&gt; return visit for LMS 
installation and training; Your previous email<BR>&gt;&gt; indicated your 
unavailable August 1st to late September thus M&amp;R's<BR>&gt;&gt; return visit 
will be addressed at that time;<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2.. Confirmation on the 
version of MSAccess NIC is utilizing;&nbsp; this can<BR>&gt;&gt; be addressed by 
installing the 'Loan Amortization' worksheet provided<BR>&gt;&gt; via email July 
7th, 2014; for your convenience the 'Loan Amortization'<BR>&gt;&gt; worksheet 
has been attached to this email (LWS_NIC.accde). The original<BR>&gt;&gt; email 
July 7th, 2014 contained detailed instructions yet basically all<BR>&gt;&gt; you 
need to do is copy the file [LWS_NIC.accde] to the [C:\Temp] folder<BR>&gt;&gt; 
and 'double-click' on the file; if you can open it MSAccess is<BR>&gt;&gt; 
installed; if not then MSAccess will need to be purchased and 
installed<BR>&gt;&gt; prior to M&amp;R's return visit; Please advise 
accordingly;<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3.. Attached please find an Excel 
Spreadsheet [NIC_LMS_Data_Templates -<BR>&gt;&gt; Outstanding Client And Loan 
Details.xls] which contains a list of loans<BR>&gt;&gt; that still require 
information (client and loan details) to be extracted<BR>&gt;&gt; from onsite 
source documents as per the original spreadsheet;<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4.. 
The file [NIC Transaction Log LMS April 2014 Forward.xlsx] is<BR>&gt;&gt; 
missing transactions for March 2014; the data files M&amp;R was provided 
on<BR>&gt;&gt; our initial visit contained transactions to February 2014; please 
update<BR>&gt;&gt; this file with March transactions accordingly and return via 
email;<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5.. Part of the conversion phase is to balance 
control totals to the<BR>&gt;&gt; information converted.&nbsp; In NIC's 
situation this can be done by reviewing<BR>&gt;&gt; a copy of NIC's 2013-2014 
fiscal year end outstanding loan balances as<BR>&gt;&gt; per identified by your 
auditors; essentially a list of the 143 loans and<BR>&gt;&gt; the balances as of 
March 31st, 2014 will need to be forward;&nbsp; of course<BR>&gt;&gt; March 
transactions as per noted in item #4 will also be 
required;<BR>&gt;&gt;<BR>&gt;&gt; Once the above information can be provided 
M&amp;R will schedule a return<BR>&gt;&gt; visit and provide an agenda for 
onsite installation and training<BR>&gt;&gt; 
respectively.<BR>&gt;&gt;<BR>&gt;&gt;<BR>&gt;&gt; Regards,<BR>&gt;&gt; Rod 
Archibald,<BR>&gt;&gt; M&amp;R Computer Solutions Ltd.<BR>&gt;&gt; Director Of 
Operations &amp; Services<BR>&gt;&gt; Phone: 250.372.2433<BR>&gt;&gt; Email:
