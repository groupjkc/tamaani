Hi Alasie,

Hope you are having a wonderful time in Hawaii!

Actually, Ray left the walrus tusk with Isi Masi here in Canada, as he =
does not want to bring it out of Canada without the necessary =
documentation and support.

So Ray says that the authorities in New Zealand have indicated that he =
would need a letter acknowledging this as a gift to Ray Totorewa from =
the former owner (which would be your husband Charlie), and also a =
permit from the Conservation Officer acknowledging that this transaction =
has taken place, and that the walrus tusk is a gift.

If Charlie could write such a letter on some kind of an official =
letterhead, and perhaps get one from the local Conservation Officer as =
well, that would help Ray a lot.

I plan to be in Kangirsuk between October 10-12, so perhaps Annie could =
bring that along with her then, if possible.

Thanks so much, Alasie, and God bless you richly.

Yours in Him,

Roger

  Hi Roger,





  Sorry took me longtime to get to see your emial, You welcome enytime
  actually the one i gave you is call silapaak.

  Right know am in Hawaii Honolulu so what is Charlie has to do is it =
too
  late know for him to right a letter?

  The youth conf. was awsome thank's again.

  Talk to you soon God bless.






  Alasie Arngak.





  Hello Alasie,

  Many thanks for your kindness toward me during our recent time in
  Kangirsujuaq.  Thank you especially for the amauti, and also thank you =
to
  Charlie for giving the walrus tusk to Ray from New Zealand, which =
meant a
  lot to him.

  I do not have Charlie's e-mail address, so was wondering if you could =
pass
  the message along to him that the walrus tusk is presently in the care =
of
  Isi Masi of the Island Breeze Manitoba, awaiting the time when =
somebody
  from here will make it to New Zealand with the necessary documentation =
to
  make it through customs.

  If Charlie could send us a letter (on an official letterhead such as =
the
  Avataq Cultural Institute if that is possible) indicating that the =
walrus
  tusk was a gift from him to Ray Totorewa when he was in his community =
of
  Kangirsujuaq in early August of 2010.

  Also, if there is a Conservation Officer in Kangirsujuaq who could =
issue
  some kind of a permit for the walrus tusk to be exported, that would =
be
  very helpful as well.

  Alasie, please let me know if this is possible, or if there is any =
problem
  in fulfilling these requests.  Thank you again for all that you did =
for us
  while in Kangirsujuaq, and God bless you richly and abundantly is my
  prayer.

  Yours with many thanks,

  Roger Armbruster
  Canada Awakening Ministries
