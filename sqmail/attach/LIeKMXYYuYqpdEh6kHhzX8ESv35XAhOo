Subject: Good news and a question...


Hi everyone,=20

I hope you are all well.  First, before I give the following =
information, I want to remind everybody that you all signed a =
confidentiality agreement and that you are binded by it. Then I want to =
ask Elisapi if she could find a way to forward this message to Jussippe, =
for whom I don't have an e-mail address..

The  good news:  we have received 26 applications  for the executive =
director position and on a first look, some seem very interesting.  I'm =
hopeful we can find a good person within those files.

The question is for Mr Tulugak:
Aliva, among the resum=E9s I received, there are two that carry the same =
name as you do:  Aani P. Tulugak and Harry Tulugak.  Are those persons =
in any way related to you ?  If so, I would strongly recommend that you =
step down from the committee and ask the board to find a substitute.  =
I'm quite sure you would try to exercice your judgment without =
partiality, but we have to prevent any appearance of conflict of =
interest.  If we don't consider this, we risk having the whole process =
rightly contested by any candidate who would learn of it or even by a =
committee or board member. Could you please get back to me as soon as =
possible so that the board can act quickly to replace you, if needed ?

Thank you and I hope to see you all in good health next week.

Have a good day.

Christiane=
