Dear Alasie,

On June 21, 2006 we came together to seek after the heart of God for our
people and nation. The Covenant of the First Peoples of Canada was birthed
with a commitment to walk together in the love of Father God.

On June 11, 2008, Prime Minister Stephen Harper apologized for the historic
wrongs and abuses experienced by our people through the implementation of
the Indian Residential School policy and he asked for forgiveness.

On June 12, 2010, we came together again as a coalition of individuals and,
in a posture of simple faith and trust in God, we believed the Lord Himself
would give us much needed healing and freedom from the spiritual bondage of
unforgiveness. We gathered to release forgiveness.

When our Prime Minister recalled the generosity of spirit behind the Charter
of Forgiveness and Freedom, he not only recognized the healing power of
forgiveness but he also recognized that forgiveness does not remove the
obligation of those who caused the wrong. There is much more to be done.

We know every new commission requires a deeper consecration and it is in
that secret place of repair, we are refined to do more.

Beyond a release of forgiveness, there is a restoration and a true freedom
that is only found in a place of total surrender and trust in God. No matter
what has been or what is before us, or even what will be, God will always be
faithful to fulfill all his promises. We are about to witness the greatest
restoration of all things.
> 
It is critical as leaders called by God to serve that we do not give up in
meeting together. 

We propose a leadership gathering to take place in June 2011 in Ottawa for
the purpose of returning to our first love and authority in Christ.

Let us continue to work and serve together to advance the kingdom of God for
our people and nation. Let us come together for a time of refreshing!
