Hi Jeannie,

The purpose of sending out the conclusions and action items was to ensure
that organizations do their part in their follow-up at this time. For your
information, these conclusions and action items were sent to all
participant in January 2011.

As for the tour, all organizations were to participate around this through
the RPC and Ungaluk. It will take some doing for all the leaders to decide
when they would all be available to do such a tour. Ungaluk has been
without a coordinator for sometime and now that there has been a new
coordinator hired, we hope discussions can be under way to have a plan to
present to the next retreat.  The Nunavik Elders' Association will also
have to be involved in the planning.

Should you have any additional questions, please do not hesitate to
contact me.
