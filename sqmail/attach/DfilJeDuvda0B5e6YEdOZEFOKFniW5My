Hello Alasie,

Sorry you were sick when our paths crossed...I hope you're feeling better
now.  I'm back in Vancouver.  Five of us--Henry Alayco, Putulik Papagatuk,
Mishal Naseer, Susie Kudluk and myself--travelled to each of the 8 Ungava
Bay and Hudson Strait communities that did the mapping.  The purpose was to
show people the village maps, get feedback at public meetings and make sure
the maps are as complete as possible.  Also, to give each respondent his or
her own copy of their map.  It went very well.  The 8 communities have
strong maps.  Kangiqsujuaq has--thanks very much to your efforts--a very
strong set of maps.  Thanks again for helping to make sure Wakeham Bay has
such good maps.  You made me (and my team) happy!

Terry
