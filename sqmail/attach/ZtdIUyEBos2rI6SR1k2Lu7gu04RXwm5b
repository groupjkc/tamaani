Alasieai,

I'm sorry thats how you feel about our friendship, I am not willing to be
friends if thats how you feel about me. I was trying to find out if you
still wanted to stay at my place and that you can call my daughter for the
keys and you said you will see. You never let me know if you were or not.
Jaaji had said he would go there with his kids and he ended up not going
and he told me only later on, and he had my keys. 

If you think I am not being a true friend well thats how you feel and I
can't do anything about it and I am not willing to be a friend to someone
who feels that way. Friendship comes and goes and I guess we will let it
be.

Vickie
