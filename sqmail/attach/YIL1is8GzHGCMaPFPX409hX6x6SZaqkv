Dear Alasie,

I am writing to follow-up on the report that I sent over to the Regional Bo=
ard for you during my visit to Kuujjuaq in June.   I would be most interest=
ed to discuss the content and implications of the report with you at your c=
onvenience.  I was unfortunately unable to meet with Larry Watt during my s=
tay in the North, but am moving ahead with a discussion of these issues wit=
h Senator Watt.

If you have not yet received the report, please let me know and I'll send y=
ou a copy by email.

yours,

Barbara=20
