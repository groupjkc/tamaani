Sorry Alacie, for not getting back to you right away but it slipped my
mind with everything going on these days.

On behalf of the BOD I am sorry to advise that your request was
unanimously declined since it would mean that they would have to do
something similar for many others in a similar situation.   I think they
felt it might be a benefit that would be more appropriately supported by
the Health Board than AIL.

Again, sorry to bring bad news

Peter
