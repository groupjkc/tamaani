Hello my precious sister. I am very happy for you and I want you to be whole 
like God meant for you to be whole, Spirit, Soul and Body.

I am sorry, I could not respond to your e-mail earlier. I have been very 
busy the last few weeks.

I know the Lord is preparing us for something much greater than what we can 
imagine or think. God is sooo great that He does things way beyond our 
imagination. And, I am glad that He is my Father. My very personal Father. I 
can communicate my heart  to Him about what is bothering me and things I do 
not understand. He is soooo patient that He moves in His perfect timing. All 
we need to do is trust Him. There is no words for it, all you can do is cry 
in awe of Him.

Nalligivatsi saimaqtiqtaugissi Jiisusiup Atinganit.
