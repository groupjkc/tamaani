Hey Alasie!!!!!

Qaniuppiit yourself ha!ha!

You are being silly, silly, silly!!!
Before you come down,try to record your songs with your Key-board.
That way,you will not be able to forget what you want.
It doesn't have to be perfect,and we can discuss and re-write 'til
we get exactly what you want.
I could see that you were unhappy with what we did,but I can't see
what is in your mind about the melody and all that.

I think Big Johnny might be down too.
Also Paulaucie from Salluit.

With my visitor,the house should be pretty full,ha!ha!

Call me when you arrive.
XOX Dougie.
