Good morning Alasie, I am not sure what agreement you have with Air
Inuit. I will be speaking with Peter this afternoon, to get guidance. I
am not sure what I am supposed to do in this situation. Since I started
last year, I was told to follow the policies put in place. That is why I
need to speak to Peter about your request. Are the travel arrangements
done by health board for your children? Please let me know.
gb
