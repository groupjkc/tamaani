Ai Alasie, Qanuippit?
Bob Carveth ujunga, Australia nngaaqpunga.
Aittaaq for troubling you, but I wonder If you may be able to help me =
with some translations in the future.
I have an interest in endangered languages and I am impressed by the =
effort that the Inuit people have put into preserving their beautiful =
language.
In my life I have travelled many paths, but at my stage of life  I now =
regret not having trod the Inuit trail.           Belatedly in life I am =
looking at the Inuit culture and realise what a wonderful people the =
Inuits are.                                I am awed by their ability to =
survive in such harsh environmental conditions, conditions that would be =
impossible for a qalunaat to survive in.
Hopefully I feel that if the Inuit people keep their traditional way of =
life intact they may survive the futuristic pressures that will be put =
on mankind.
I have read Melanie McGrath's book "The Long Exile" and it touched me =
deeply. To subject people to such inhuman treatment goes to the core of =
my soul.                        Those bloody qalunaats in power at the =
time manipulating those beautiful people into such precarious locations =
as a "land holding exercise" almost made me weep.

I have never met an Inuit, but look forward to the day I do.

I think it is wonderful how the school system promotes the teaching of =
Inuktitut in the the first three years of schooling and reinforcing that =
learning throughout the following years of schooling.
I personally see the issue of promoting the retention of the Inuktitut =
language as an identity issue. I believe that maintaining the use of =
their forbearer's language affirms and strengthens the identity of the =
student as an Inuit.
In doing my little bit towards promoting the students learning Inuktitut =
I have linked with Principal of Ulluriaq school at Kangiqsualujjuak and =
have donoted over $2,000.00 worth of prizes to be handed out to the =
Students at Christmas this year.
There will be a major prize (such as a digital camera) for every class =
and a participation prize for every student.
Although I live on the extreme opposite of the globe, it lessens not my =
enthusiasm to help to contribute to promote the retention of the =
Inuktitut language.
I have beeen toying with the idea of putting together a small speech in =
Inuktitut that could be played to the students at the prize presentation =
night at Christmas.
It is this bit of translation I need a hand with and I wonder if you =
could assist me with this exercise.
I am aware of the different dialects in Nunavik and I think the dialect =
spoken at Kangiksualujjuaq would be similiar to the South Qikiqtaaluk =
dialect.
I look forward to hear from you
Namimiutsajauvit?
Tavvaujutit
Bob Carveth
