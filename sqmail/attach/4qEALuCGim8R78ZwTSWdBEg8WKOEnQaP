I happened to be listening to your radio activity update yesterday on Tutta=
vik on behalf as chairman of NRBHSS. I absolutely am appalled that you spok=
e about me on the public radio when you should know of all people that this=
 is confidential information that has been an in camera discussion between =
only the board members of the NRBHSS. This is unacceptable. And as you know=
=2C there is no conclusion yet on the matters concerning myself.=20

Lastly=2C if I am not mistaken=2C you do not have the authority no longer a=
s chairman and had no business falsely posing as the authority of the NRBHS=
S unless you were mandated by the board.

I expect a prompt response from the board members of the NRBHSS rectifying =
this situation.
