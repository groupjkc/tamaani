Alasiigai,

It is good to hear from you!
I have not heard from you since Rankin Inlet.
I am sorry to hear that you going through some disappoitment and confusion 
in your marriage.
I have gone through alot of that too for many years, but my marriage 
relationship is much better and is still improving even at times there are 
some disappointments. No matter how hard my relationship has been in the 
past, I have told myself many times "Keep On Keeping On" I have chosen to 
keep believing the promises of God's Word whether I feel like or not. I am 
finally seeing the results, even though what I believed for didn't seem to 
happen for many many years. Alasie, all I can say is; give your burdens to 
the Lord once again and He will put things back together as He has always 
done in the past.
I have found out that we human beings don't learn easily. As a matter of 
fact some are very stubborn that it takes almost all their life to finally 
learn to stand.

I have prayed for you as I always will. As long as you let me know your need 
I will keep praying for you.

I love you deeply in the love of the Lord. You are very special and precious 
in His sight.

Be Blessed and be Released in Jesus Mighty Name!

Brother
Billy Arnaquq
