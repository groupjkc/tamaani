Hello Alasie:  Hope you are doing well.  Sorry to bother you again -

but could you put the money ($200.) that you borrowed into my bank

account at CIBC? I would really appreciate it as I could use it right

now.  You can call my husband, Julius at the office at 250-652-7097 and

he would be happy to give it to you.  I am travelling this week so it

is better to communicate with him.   Thanks again.
