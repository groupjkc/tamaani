Hi Alasie,

Qanuingitunga, I wish I could go, but I am very busy at this time. Daisy 
can't go either because of her work, she can't take a holiday until July 2, 
2008.

Jordan Tootoo is in town, promoting education. My wife drove him in our 
truck after his arrival.

I am now very busy during the summer season because of my Outfitting 
Business. Many tourist comes to my area mostly in Spring and Summer.

Have a great week at the Conference.
I know Jesus will do miracles in the lives of His children as He has 
promised.
I love Him very much, without Him I am nothing, but with Him I have 
everything.

We love you very much. Kunik your younger son for me. I am sorry I can't 
come.

Abundant Blessings
Billy
