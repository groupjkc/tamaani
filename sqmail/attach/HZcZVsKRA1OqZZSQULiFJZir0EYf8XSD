Ullaakut Jusipi=2C

Following our conversation last week here in Montreal concerning the credit=
 card situation=2C I would like to know what the next steps are of the heal=
th board. As you mentioned=2C the SQ have found no fraudulent activity conc=
erning myself and Alasie with the corporate credit card. In the last media =
update by the health board=2C it was mentioned that there was a police inve=
stigation. I think it would be fair if you on behalf of the Health Board gi=
ve a media update on the final situation.

Nakurmiik Juuspi=2C I look forward hearing from you=2C
