<p><font size="2" face="sans-serif">Hi Mary!</font><br>
<br>
<font size="2" face="sans-serif">Hope you are doing great as well as you team members. &nbsp;I saw on the news there was a fire in Kuujjuak, hopefully no one was injured!</font><br>
<br>
<font size="2" face="sans-serif">Sorry for taking so long to get back on the proposal! &nbsp;I do have a shortage in Human Resouces! &nbsp;It is a challenge but I try my best.</font><br>
<br>
<font size="2" face="sans-serif">I have questions on the workplan and on the budget forecasts.</font><br>
<br>
<font size="2" face="sans-serif">I will try to be clear so you can answer them rapidly and for some points we will have to ajust the plan and the forecasts.</font><br>

<ol type="1" style="padding-left: 18pt">
<li><font size="2" face="sans-serif">Your workplan speaks for one year but in some case up to l 15-16 , so logically expenditures should not be the same &nbsp;i,e, for workshop?</font>
<li><font size="2" face="sans-serif">Can you clarify , the budgets and plan are &nbsp;for: &nbsp;# of part time RHSW's, &nbsp;# of full time RHSW's + # of Part time CSP and # of full Time CSP</font>
<li><font size="2" face="sans-serif">I am confused on who is what , Need names and tittles</font>
<li><font size="2" face="sans-serif">On which forecasts are you , under RHSW for 3 workers including you?</font>
<li><font size="2" face="sans-serif">In your workplan Page 2 - second line -third colon: You have proposed only regular gathering with your staff, when do you meet with then individually? We have to ensure their clinical supervision for each of them, so we can address their own concerns at least once a month!</font>
<li><font size="2" face="sans-serif">Same page &nbsp;third line- third colon: &nbsp; &nbsp;Yes files are kept in a confidential place and locked &nbsp;in Kuujjuak but what it is for the workers in community? You need to ensure that files are locked.</font>
<li><font size="2" face="sans-serif">You plan to invite guests from Dialogue for life and train your staff in Crisis and Trauma ? &nbsp; $35,000 &nbsp; aside for this? &nbsp;We are to provide support not train the communties , Explain?</font>
<li><font size="2" face="sans-serif">Have you considered meeting with The Treatment Center director&amp; clients, present at AGM and the Nunavick organizations in the region, it is not mentionned in the plan</font>
<li><font size="2" face="sans-serif">Do you intend to work with these partners for an integration of services/complementary services to meet Formers Students and families needs.</font>
<li><font size="2" face="sans-serif">Travel fees are over 100K &nbsp;can you define frequency and location its is very high and it should match with who and why workers travel</font>
<li><font size="2" face="sans-serif">&nbsp;CSP: Professional fees 15,000$ when you ask for 82,427 for honorarium ??</font>
<li><font size="2" face="sans-serif">RHSW Professioanl fees 35.000$ ?? &nbsp; </font>
<li></ol>
<font size="2" face="sans-serif">Thanks for you collaboration Mary, I hope my questions make sense with you. &nbsp;I will expect some answers in the week to come??</font><br>
<br>
<font size="2" face="sans-serif">Bye!</font><br>
