Hi ,all of you.

I talk to Christiane Rouleau about the  two requests, and firt, she =
accept to be at the meeting of the board of directors in  june at =
Kuujurapik. The best would be that the meeting that concern the =
engagement of the new general director happen the 9 in the morning so =
that she could come back in Montreal in the afternoon. For the second =
point, she will make a phone to the candidate to give the information =
about the process..Mary and Gerald will also receive this message, Is it =
possible to confirm to Christiane her fly and hotel reservation.
Rouleau, Christiane       rouleauconsult@videotron.ca
  Res. : 450-668-5471
  Cell. : 514-298-2283

Can somebody give the information to Jussipie.

Thank you!

Best regards !

Pierre.
