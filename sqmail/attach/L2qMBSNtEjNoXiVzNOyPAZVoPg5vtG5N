Hello Alasie,
In response to your request, the best I can help with is that I can ask for a=
n early "Ilaujuq" certificate for both you and your daughter.

Please take note that each local board members are given 20 passes but they a=
re meant to help the community at large.  At times they are given away durin=
g festivities such Christmas games.

We urge your daughter to work for Air Inuit so she may be eligible to get fr=
ee employee passes.

Air Inuit board receives so many requests for additional certificates but to=
 give everyone a chance to travel, we limit the "Ilaujuq" certificate twice p=
er year for all beneficiaries.

Please also take note that we have instructed the management of Air Inuit no=
t to give free passes unless they are given by their local Makivik rep.

We have many other discount programs like compassionate travel but in your c=
ase, it is not covered.

We look forward to receiving your daughter's CV for future consideration.

With regards,


Noah Tayara
Air Inuit Board member.
