Hi again,

I forgot to write, you have to contact Service Canada to provide the
required information and have the file being resumed, failing to contact
them which the Common Experience Payment claim will be dismissed by
Canada. 

Let me know when you contact them by calling them at 1-866-699-1742. 

Thank you!
