Hi Alasie=2C

I was going to give you a call however I know you are just arriving and pre=
fer you call me when you can give me 15 minutes of your attention. I think =
we are having some serious communication issues. As you know=2C I was to wo=
rk on the SRP during my maternity leave and only start my maternity leave o=
n the date of the birth of my baby. I must still sit with Larry concerning =
the Directors as we did not have a chance because of the issues I had with =
Silas within the last month.=20

I have come to understand you met with Hani and ordered Silas to cancel my =
corporate credit card without notifying me. I went to purchase supplies to =
work at home today and was declined. Why haven't you or someone informed me=
 of your decision to cancel the card?=20
I am very upset also with Silas as he has not repied to any of my email to =
work on the corporate credit card issue. I have been trying to meet him sin=
ce after the AGM so I may know how much I actually owe and so I will pay of=
f the total amount once I know how much it really is.=20

I hope you answer me clearly since no one seems to know how to communicate =
lately.=20

Jeannie
