Good morning Gilles=2C I have sent many correspondence to the Health Board =
since November 2011 to the board of directors and to Larry Watt when he was=
 still the Acting Executive Director concerning various topics. I have not =
received one reply to all my letters and emails. I don't think it is my job=
 to resend them. I would most appreciate it if my letters and emails could =
be responded to.  Thank you=2CJeannie 		 	   		  =
