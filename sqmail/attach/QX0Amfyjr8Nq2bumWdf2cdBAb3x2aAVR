If you have time, could you please call Alasie ask what she means. Is
the cheque lost?
This is from November, so could you please locate the RFC # for me for
Timoti Editloie so that I can follow-up with this?

Thank you,

truck rental I think it was put in the garbage while in the envolope,
His
was gone for a while when i recived it, So when i try to give it to him
