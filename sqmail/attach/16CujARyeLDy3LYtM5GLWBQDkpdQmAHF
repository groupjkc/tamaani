Board Members=2C I am writing to you in request for a very important reason=
. As you know=2C I have received and read the BDO audit report that was con=
ducted at the beginning of this year following the situation with the corpo=
rate credit card. And I am aware that all board members have read the repor=
t also at the February board of directors meeting. It is without doubt that=
 there is no fraud and any other illegal activities done by myself and by A=
lasie Arngak.  In 2 different articles appearing in the Nunatsiaq News=2C m=
y reputation along with Alasie's were completely ruined due to a leak comin=
g from the board meeting held in Kuujjuaq in December 2011. The recommendat=
ions report completed by Raymond Chabot Grant Thorton auditors was made pub=
lic at that time by someone within the board of directors=2C if not an empl=
oyee aware of this situation. Confidential information was made public=2C t=
o read further=2C please read the article: http://www.nunatsiaqonline.ca/st=
ories/article/65674nunavik_health_boards_executive_director_president_face/=
 And again=2C an article appeared in the same newspaper stating very simila=
r allegations=2C please read further at: http://www.nunatsiaqonline.ca/stor=
ies/article/65674nunavuk_health_board_reviews_report_on_alleged_misuse_of_f=
unds/ With this said=2C I am officially requesting for the board of directo=
rs of the Nunavik Regional Board of Health & Social Services to apologize b=
y resolution to myself and Mrs. Alasie Arngak. And more importantly we woul=
d like for this resolution to be made public so our reputation can be resto=
red. I am certain as board members you understand our situation and believe=
 you will work in good faith. Lastly this situation effects not just Alasie=
 and myself=2C but the repuation of our whole organization.   I thank you f=
or your time and hope to hear from you soon.  Sincerely=2C  Jeannie May Ple=
