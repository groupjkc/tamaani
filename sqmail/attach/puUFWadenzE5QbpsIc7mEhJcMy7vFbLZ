Hi Alasie,

I just want to say, hi!
It was so good to see you happy in Salluit. I am glad the Lord has restored 
you into your rightful place. I am very happy for you.

I pray that the Lord will continue to lead you and use you as He has planned 
for your life.

Love you very much in Christ.

Bro. Billy
