Hi to you too.

>From the time I receive pictures and whatever you want to
be written on the CD,I can have CDs hands in one week.

Not bad eh ????

Shipping is another thing.At least 2 weeks.
However if you know someone who is to be here from Wakeum,
they could bring you some with them.

Shipping now costs almost 50 cents per CD with insurance
and all.

Bye bye now
