Hi everyone

About two years ago, when I was replacing Jeannie, the group of=20
negotiators with Fernand Roy asked us to be ready when the Quebec=20
government would come with all the changes proposed in all the different=20
laws that must be done to enable the merger of three organizations.=20

Being ready meant having a lawyer look closely all proposed changes and=20
see if NRHBSS understands and accepts the new rules of the game=20

After consulting Alasie I verbally asked John Hurley if it was in his area =

of expertise and whether he would be interested in such a mandate. His=20
response was positive. No other agreement has occurred.=20

I do not see how we would have work for a full-time lawyer at the Regional =

Board.=20

What we saw in the last five years, from time to time we need the help of=20
a lawyer regarding working conditions when we have to dismiss an employee, =

we usually go with a specialized lawer in that field.=20
Occasionally we had to consult a lawyer concerning the elections.=20
And in our negotiations with the MSSS on our  Strategic Regional Plan=20
(SRP) we had a lawyer.=20

I think in the process that will take us to NRG we should hire a lawyer=20
that would be available when we need and that would be paid at an hourly=20
rate.=20
This lawer would do what I mention in the second  paragraph and also what=20
Jean-Guy is mentionning:=20
Such lawyer would mainly be advising the NRBHSS during the transition=20
period (of 2 years) making sure that the amalgamation is done in=20
accordance with the "Final Agreement" and its subsequent Quebec Government =

relative legislation.

For now there is no emergency in this file. I think we should have a phone =

conference on this topic when these individuals are available: Alasie,=20
Jeannie,Jean-Guy, Silas and Gilles=20

Have a good day

NRG, Lawyer







Hi Silas,

Following your phone call of this morning I called Jean-Fran=E7ois Arteau t=
o=20
know more about the possibility to hire a lawyer for the NRBHSS in the=20
Nunavik Regional Government (NRG) file for its eventual implementation.

Here is what I understood from my conversation with Jean-Frna=E7ois:

1. Recently, Pita recommended to Alasie, that the NRBHSS should hire a=20
lawyer in the NRG file since we are the only public organization to be=20
amalgamated that does not have a full time one.

2. It is up to the NRBHSS to have one or not.

3. Such lawyer would mainly be advising the NRBHSS during the transition=20
period (of 2 years) making sure that the amalgamation is done in=20
accordance with the "Final Agreement" and its subsequent Quebec Government =

relative legislation.

Silas and I, should remain in the functions we are presently doing and=20
assist the lawyer if the case maybe.

Silas and I, can recommand names, if you want.

Additional information:

At the present time the negotiations for the Final Agreement are almost=20
completed. As soon as this is cleared up the information tour might begin=20
by next February 14: to be confirmed.
