Hi Charlie and Alasie,

I recently received a list of names that started their application for
common experience payment forms with federal government as former
residential school students but they have not completed or information is
missing. 

Charlie, your name was one of them and Service Canada is missing
information with your application, could you contact them by telephone at
1-866-699-1742. They are requesting proof of indetitly as stated on
form-individual. 

As for my understanding, this means they need proof of identification
which could be:

-original birth certificate;
OR
-2 pieces of original identification cards or certified copies such as *
health card, *driver's license, *indian status or *passport, if you use
passport, it cannot be expired. 

-If you submit identification cards, one of them has to have a photo
identification.

If you have questions, call me or email me back.

I would like to know when you call and what they say to you, could you let
me know. Thank you!

Annie Baron
