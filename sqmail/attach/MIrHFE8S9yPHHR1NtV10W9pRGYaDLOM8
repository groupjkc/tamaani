Jeannie,
I have to set the facts straight as you were the one screaming at me on =
the telephone in October-I have several witnesses that heard you. You =
have chosen to make this a personal matter by harassing my daughter and =
my granddaughter Katie Ann this week. They would not have even known =
about the matter and the letter I sent you if you yourself had not told =
my granddaughter yesterday afternoon. The letter I sent is about your =
work conduct and is not of a personal nature. Valerie and Katie Ann are =
very stressed from your screaming and threats. It makes it particularly =
hard for my daughter because she works for the Health Board and you are =
the Executive Director there. It will definitely be easier if you do not =
get them involved.=20

Therefore, I want you to immediately stop calling my daughter and her =
daughter, otherwise you will leave no choice but to call the police =
about the harassment.  This is not a threat because the police will be =
called. I will also be watching to make sure that my daughter Valerie is =
not given a hard time or prejudices over this in her work place, =
otherwise I will report any kind oh harassment.

I do not wish you to contact me again.

Subject: Your work as Executive Director of NRBHSS
Date: Thu, 10 Feb 2011 11:22:23 -0500



Dear Jeannie,

I have tried to reach you but obviously you are not taking my calls. I =
am writing to you as your Aunt and as an individual who is very =
concerned about the situation at the health board. I often find myself a =
spokesperson for others who are not able to say the things they want to =
say. Having received a call from one of the Board members of Nunavik =
Health Board, the call propelled me into writing this email although I =
have thought about doing it many times before.  I want to let you know =
that many people are concerned about your lack of involvement in the =
management of the health board. I believe I am doing you justice in =
letting you know this. I am sending a copy of this email to the chair of =
the NRBHSS as she and the rest of the Board of Directors are ultimately =
responsible for the operation of the Board and are responsible to =
provide supervision to the Executive Director.

As witnessed by many, your lack of involvement and absences over the =
past 5 years and more (I am not speaking about legitimate absences such =
as maternity leave, justified sick leave, annual holidays, etc. as these =
are benefits that all employees are entitled to) are astronomical and =
your complete lack of interest in the work of the Executive Director of =
the Nunavik Health Board is apparent to many people. Over the past 5 =
years, your absences have included numerous and prolonged trips to B.C. =
to visit one of your children=92 father over a 2-3 year period. For the =
past two years and more, your trips to the Dominican Republic have been =
exhaustive, frequent once again in connection to visiting your current =
husband. I am not passing judgment on your personal life, that is your =
business. However, your absences and total lack of commitment and =
neglect provide no continuity to the Board have leave the organization =
in serious and precarious jeopardy.

The role of Executive Director are key to the running of the =
organization. The Executive Director is responsible for the =
implementation of decisions made by the Executive Committee and the =
Board of Directors and has to ensure that the administrative Directors =
continually work towards the direction that the BOD decides on. The =
departments, through their directors must be supervised and supported on =
a continual basis by their Executive Director. Without the support and =
guidance, an organization will go directionless and its work will be =
very ineffectual. This is the situation that I and many others feel is =
the state the Health Board is in right now and has been for a long time =
now. You are responsible for many critical files at the health board but =
you do not take your job seriously by any stretch of the imagination.

As Inuit we are in great crises at this time in our history. The Nunavik =
Regional Board of Health and Social Services, has the mandate to provide =
strong and effective services to the Inuit of Nunavik. The Board is =
provided a great deal of money by Governments to do this job. My =
interpretation of your work is that you are not interested in doing it =
at all, nor do you care and I have found this disturbing over the years. =
As you know, I have attempted many times to support you and get you =
involved in the issues that are important to the wellbeing of our people =
as well as other issues we are concerned about as Inuit. Each and every =
time I have tried to speak with you to involve you over the past years, =
your response to me has always been that you don=92t interfere with the =
work of department heads and that it is their responsibility and not =
yours to deal with things so I have to speak with them instead. I have =
never had any problems with dept. heads who are Inuit-I am not concerned =
about them as they are not in contradiction. It is not the Inuit =
department heads who do not respect the wishes of the Board of =
Directors. It is the non Inuit department heads who either do not agree =
with the way the Board wants to do things are are still oppressing us =
and thinking they know better than we do as Inuit who I am concerned =
about. Part of your role is to definitely intervene with them if they =
are not complying. You as the Executive Director has to be in the front =
lines ready to work everyday and ensure that the Board=92s direction is =
adhered to.  That is what you are paid to do. There is much work to be =
done in Health and Social Services-the staff at the Board need support =
and guidance.  Your complete lack of interest in critical areas has left =
the people of Nunavik in a very vulnerable position.  The people deserve =
more.

I believe I am doing you a great favor by letting you know this and even =
if you do not realize it now, perhaps you will one day. I believe it is =
important for you to come to a decision about whether you are interest =
in this work or not. There are people able and willing to do the job of =
Executive Director if you are not ready and willing to give it your =
best. Furthermore, the Health Board is not a private business owned by a =
few-it is a public institution and people who are privileged to work in =
it are accountable to both the public it serves and the funders.

I trust you will carefully consider what I have written.
