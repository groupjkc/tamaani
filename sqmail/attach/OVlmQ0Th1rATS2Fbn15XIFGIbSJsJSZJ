Bonjour,

Alasie, it is good to hear from you, you are not the only person busy. I 
have been busy also with my clients who are visiting the Park, the church 
life and personal life.

I am learning a little bit of french since some of my clients are from 
France.

I was hoping to see you in Pond Inlet, but you didn't show up, I quess I 
know why now.

I am sorry I won't be in Iqaluit by that time, my wife might be there, but I 
don't know the exact dates.

I miss you too, I wish I could talk with you heart to heart.

Love in Christ
Billy
