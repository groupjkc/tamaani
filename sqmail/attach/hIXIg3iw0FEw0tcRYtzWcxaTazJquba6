Good morning Andy=2C
=20
Thank you for the follow-ups to do=2C however I'm wondering why it has arri=
ved 7 months later? My board had two questions concerning the follow-ups fr=
om our meeting in December. As you are probably aware=2C we have a few elde=
rs on our board that were present at the elders and leaders retreat. One qu=
estion was=2C why the tour has not begun yet? If we remember correctly=2C d=
elegated elders and leaders were to visit the communities and talk about we=
lllness and healthy communities. Also=2C I had mentioned a few times at the=
 retreat that the health board could organize a healing session for the eld=
ers and the leaders. It was pointed out by a few of the elders that this is=
 a necessary step if we are to move forward to a healthy future.

Thank you=2C I await for your reply=2C
