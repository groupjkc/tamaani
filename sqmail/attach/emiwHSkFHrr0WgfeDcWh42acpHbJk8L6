Sialla ai,

Thanks for your message. Qanuinngitunga, but for the time being the =
doctor asks me to go to Richelieu, where my diabetes will be better =
looked after. I would like to stay here at Qu=E9bec, but the doctors and =
nurses have to much work to do (g=F4k) and do not accept new patients =
for now. I will leave probably next week. We will be able to communicate =
by E-Mail anyway. I love you all and pray for you, pray for me also. May =
the Good Lord bless you. Sauningai, aalummi.=20

P. Dion omi
