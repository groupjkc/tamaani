My Table of Eight
I am supposed to pick 8 women who have touched my life and whom I think
might participate. Please send this back to me. Remember to just read the
quotation. That's all you have to do. There is nothing attached. Just send
this to eight women. Sorry you have to forward the message, but try not to
break this, please. 

 

 

Quote:
"May today there be peace within. May you trust that you are exactly where
you are meant to be. May you not forget the infinite possibilities that are
born of faith in yourself and others. May you use the gifts that you have
received, and pass on the love that has been given to you. May you be
content with yourself just the way you are. Let this knowledge settle into
your bones, and allow your soul the freedom to sing, dance, praise and love.
It is there for each and every one of us."

Now, send this to 8 women or more. And remember to send this back. I count
as 1. You'll see why.
