Hi Alacie,

I received the open letter from the Health board and I just want to express
and share with you my thoughts on this matter. I certainly agree this is a
very unfortunate situation under the circumstances and many people seem to
have comments on it.

I am aware of the circumstances that lead to Annie Poperts dismissal and I
will not comment on this for personal reasons as this concerns my niece and
my sister.  What I want to comment on is the decision that was made to end
Annie Poperts contracts. I feel that this should of been brought to the
board prior to such a decision and certainly to meet with both parties.  As
managers and directors we must be ready to take criticism even if we do not
agree with what is said and this is a very important quality needed in order
to be able to work with people and go ahead.

You have indicated the healing contract was not one of the contracts that
was canceled and that it was to do with the youth protection file.  I have
to say whether its the healing contract or not, this work that Annie does
will always be part of the process and it certainly is in the clinical
projects.  I am a member of the advisory committee on the clinical project
on youth.  We had a very productive meeting at the last meeting, some very
important points were discussed and the next steps that were to be taken.
One of the points mentioned was to involve the population in the clinical
projects and to also include the healing component  in this process.

I would like to conclude by saying we have fellow Inuit that are valuable to
us in the work we are doing and they are far in between.  We must think
wisely before any such decision are made and I believe there are always ways
of working things out in a better way as in this case.
Nakirmiik and have a nice day.

Sara Tagoona.
