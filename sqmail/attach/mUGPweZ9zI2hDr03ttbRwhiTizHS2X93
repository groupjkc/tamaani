I just sent an E-Mail to Pita and he is saying that unless you are a guest
of an Air Inuit Employee, we can't accept anyone else because the place we
are renting, can't have more then 400 and we are just over that with our
employee's and their guests, Sorry. None of the regional organziations
have been invited.
