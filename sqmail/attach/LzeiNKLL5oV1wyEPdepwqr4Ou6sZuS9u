Juspipiai=2C As I mentioned in my previous email to you=2C KMHB will be ren=
ovating my house and should be ready the 2nd or 3rd week of January. Why ca=
n't the health board give me just that time to wait for it to be ready? For=
 your information=2C I am paying rent and I think giving that extra couple =
of weeks should not be an issue. This situation is out of my control as KMH=
B has just finished building their houses and the people occupying the dwel=
ling I've been assigned are moving out next week.They then will make the ne=
cessary renovations.  Believe me=2C I would of been out of the health board=
 staff house the day my contract ended however as we all know=2C we have a =
major housing shortage in Nunavik and this was not possible. With that said=
=2C I have been more than grateful to have been given up until January to o=
ccupy this house as there had been no housing available for us at the time =
my contract ended.  Merry Christmas=2C Jeannie
