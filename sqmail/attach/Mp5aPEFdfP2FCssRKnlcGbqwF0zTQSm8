What is an INTERAC e-Transfer? (previously INTERAC Email Money Transfer).  =
If you use online or mobile banking at a participating financial institutio=
n, you can send and receive money quickly and easily.

Email or text messages carry the notice while the financial institutions se=
curely transfer the money using existing payment networks.  If your financi=
al institution does not yet offer INTERAC e-Transfer, you can still deposit=
 transfers to any bank account in Canada. Click http://www.interac.ca/consu=
mers/faqs.php#emt for details.
