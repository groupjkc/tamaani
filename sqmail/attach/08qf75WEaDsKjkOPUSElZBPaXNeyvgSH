as you may or may not know=2C the meeting did not go very well. Mayor Samso=

process of change the zoning for the building so that we could not build th=

We were able to make certain points and she wants us to make the presentati=
on to her municiapal council at the end of the month.......my concern is th=
at the clock is ticking away and we will not have enough time - even if the=
y do finally give us authorization to proceed. I think now we need to look =
at all possibilities.

In the short term=2C we could move eveything to the YMCA - however we would=
 have to layoff employeess=2C housekeping=2C security=2C Aramark  etc......=
unless of course we could try and get the Y to hire them on temporarily.

As for  a permanent solution=2C I have asked to meet with Dr porter - DG of=
 MUHC to see if we could obtain some land at the future site - maybe we sho=
uld be building there now - even tho they wont be there for a few years.

1. parking

 Jeannie - can you approach the Ministry of Education to get a list of vaca=

We have "put all of our eggs in one basket" and that is never a good thing =

Bonsoir =C9ric=2C

This is a great short and precise presentation that Larry Watt will do tomo=
rrow morning concerning the MNQ services in Montreal infront of the local p=
rovincial deputy to the National Assembly Gerry Sklavoulos=3B Mayoresse Ann=
ie Samson=2C of Montreal Villery district=3B Jane Beaudoin and Luc Gu=E9net=
te from Inuulitsivik Health Centre=3B David Levine=2C Chair and Executive D=
irector of the Montreal H.S.S. Agency=3B along with his assistant Louise Ma=
ssicotte and his Associate Director of Fixed Assets and Medical technologie=
s Hai Pham-Huy.

The mission of the MNQ defines well its essential link between Nunavik and =
Montreal.

Those who wanted more details will be well served and the fact that the MNQ=
 services in Montreal is part of the Quebec Premier's project called "Plan =
Nord" (Northern Plan).

Transmit my support to Larry Watt and to Jane Beaudoin the latter being a m=
ember of the Nunavik Regional Board of Health and Social Services Board of =
Directors.

Yours=2C
