Good Morning,

I will try to get a picture of Jordan, if he's not gone already. It is good 
to hear that your daughter is still playing hockey. Jordan has become a role 
model for many in the north, I think he is the youngest Inuit Millionaire, I 
know we can accomplish something great if we are really determined.

My Dad and Mom are still camping, I'm sure they will be back this week or 
next week. We would love to have you if you can come. We are having a Bible 
Conference February 23-26/09, maybe you can come at that time.

Keep in touch, we love you and your family very much.

Billy
