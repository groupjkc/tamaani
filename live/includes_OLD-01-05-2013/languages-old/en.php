                                    Very easily installed by following these steps:<br />
                                    <ol  >
                                      <li>Pick up the modem and rotate the attached base until it clicks into  place. This will help the modem stay upright.<br /> </li>
                                      <li> Connect the power supply cable to the power supply.<br /> </li>
                                      <li>Connect the power supply to the round plug at the base of the modem.<br />  </li>
                                      <li> Plug the power supply into the wall. The modem should now turn on.<br />  </li>
                                      <li>When the modem powers up, you will see some of the green lights at the  top of the modem come on. This is the modem 
                                      self-test sequence. The sequence  
                                      takes a few seconds to complete. Once this is done, the modem will try to  connect to the tower in your community<br />  
                                      </li>
                                      <li>After the self-test you should see a number of lights blinking on the  modem. The number of blinking lights indicates the
                                       strength of the signal.  
                                      Rotate the modem until you get the most number of lights blinking to get the  best possible signal. The modem will work properly and at full speed even if 
                                       only one of the lights remains lit.  </li>
                                      <li> Make sure your computer is off and plug the Ethernet Cable from the modem to  the computers Ethernet port.<br />  </li>
                                      <li>Turn on your computer and wait for it to finish booting up. Once your  computer is on, you should see the lights on the modem
                                       remain solidly lit.  
                                       </li>

                                      The NextNet modem  connects to your computer through an Ethernet adapter. Below is a picture of an  Ethernet adapter as it might look on the back

                                      Please note  that there are many different brands of Ethernet adapters and you may have a  different number of lights, but the socket is standard 
									  and should be identical.

								The chase sequence (lights light up one at a time, one after the other repeatedly) indicates that the modem is searching for Tamaani&#8217;s antenna.
                                 This usually happens when the signal is too weak for the modem to lock on. Try rotating the modem or moving it closer to a window or to a different room. 
                                 If the modem still can&#8217;t lock on, please call Tamaani Internet&#8217;s technical support.

								If a number of lights (from one to five depending on signal strength) are blinking steadily, this indicates that the modem has locked onto the tower, 
                                but it is not connected to your computer (or the computer is off). If the small light between the power connector and the Ethernet socket on the modem is off, 
                                your modem is not connected to your computer. Check the Ethernet cable between the modem and your computer and make sure your computer is on. Try to reseat (jiggle)
                                the Ethernet cable and make sure it is firmly plugged into the Ethernet socket on both the modem and your computer. If the lights continue to blink, 
                                the cable may need to be replaced, or the Ethernet adapter on your computer may be misconfigured or defective.

                                Double check the green light on the modem&#8217;s power supply and make sure it is lit. If the power supply light is not lit, 
                                the modem is not getting any power. Double check the connection between the power cord and the power supply. If the light on the power
